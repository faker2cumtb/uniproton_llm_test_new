 * Watermark modifiers -- controls access to emergency reserves
 * ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 *
 * %__GFP_HIGH indicates that the caller is high-priority and that granting
 * the request is necessary before the system can make forward progress.
 * For example, creating an IO context to clean pages.
 *
 * %__GFP_ATOMIC indicates that the caller cannot reclaim or sleep and is
 * high priority. Users are typically interrupt handlers. This may be
 * used in conjunction with %__GFP_HIGH
 *
 * %__GFP_MEMALLOC allows access to all memory. This should only be used when
 * the caller guarantees the allocation will allow more memory to be freed
 * very shortly e.g. process exiting or swapping. Users either should
 * be the MM or co-ordinating closely with the VM (e.g. swap over NFS).
 * Users of this flag have to be extremely careful to not deplete the reserve
 * completely and implement a throttling mechanism which controls the
 * consumption of the reserve based on the amount of freed memory.
 * Usage of a pre-allocated pool (e.g. mempool) should be always considered
 * before using this flag.
 *
 * %__GFP_NOMEMALLOC is used to explicitly forbid access to emergency reserves.
 * This takes precedence over the %__GFP_MEMALLOC flag if both are set.

/**
 * DOC: Reclaim modifiers
 *
 * Reclaim modifiers
 * ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 * Please note that all the following flags are only applicable to sleepable
 * allocations (e.g. %GFP_NOWAIT and %GFP_ATOMIC will ignore them).
 *
 * %__GFP_IO can start physical IO.
 *
 * %__GFP_FS can call down to the low-level FS. Clearing the flag avoids the
 * allocator recursing into the filesystem which might already be holding
 * locks.
 *
 * %__GFP_DIRECT_RECLAIM indicates that the caller may enter direct reclaim.
 * This flag can be cleared to avoid unnecessary delays when a fallback
 * option is available.
 *
 * %__GFP_KSWAPD_RECLAIM indicates that the caller wants to wake kswapd when
 * the low watermark is reached and have it reclaim pages until the high
 * watermark is reached. A caller may wish to clear this flag when fallback
 * options are available and the reclaim is likely to disrupt the system. The
 * canonical example is THP allocation where a fallback is cheap but
 * reclaim/compaction may cause indirect stalls.
 *
 * %__GFP_RECLAIM is shorthand to allow/forbid both direct and kswapd reclaim.
 *
 * The default allocator behavior depends on the request size. We have a concept
 * of so called costly allocations (with order > %PAGE_ALLOC_COSTLY_ORDER).
 * !costly allocations are too essential to fail so they are implicitly
 * non-failing by default (with some exceptions like OOM victims might fail so
 * the caller still has to check for failures) while costly requests try to be
 * not disruptive and back off even without invoking the OOM killer.
 * The following three modifiers might be used to override some of these
 * implicit rules
 *
 * %__GFP_NORETRY: The VM implementation will try only very lightweight
 * memory direct reclaim to get some memory under memory pressure (thus
 * it can sleep). It will avoid disruptive actions like OOM killer. The
 * caller must handle the failure which is quite likely to happen under
 * heavy memory pressure. The flag is suitable when failure can easily be
 * handled at small cost, such as reduced throughput
 *
 * %__GFP_RETRY_MAYFAIL: The VM implementation will retry memory reclaim
 * procedures that have previously failed if there is some indication
 * that progress has been made else where.  It can wait for other
 * tasks to attempt high level approaches to freeing memory such as
 * compaction (which removes fragmentation) and page-out.
 * There is still a definite limit to the number of retries, but it is
 * a larger limit than with %__GFP_NORETRY.
 * Allocations with this flag may fail, but only when there is
 * genuinely little unused memory. While these allocations do not
 * directly trigger the OOM killer, their failure indicates that
 * the system is likely to need to use the OOM killer soon.  The
 * caller must handle failure, but can reasonably do so by failing
 * a higher-level request, or completing it only in a much less
 * efficient manner.
 * If the allocation does fail, and the caller is in a position to
 * free some non-essential memory, doing so could benefit the system
 * as a whole.
 *
 * %__GFP_NOFAIL: The VM implementation _must_ retry infinitely: the caller
 * cannot handle allocation failures. The allocation could block
 * indefinitely but will never return with failure. Testing for
 * failure is pointless.
 * New users should be evaluated carefully (and the flag should be
 * used only when there is no reasonable failure policy) but it is
 * definitely preferable to use the flag rather than opencode endless
 * loop around allocator.
 * Using this flag for costly allocations is _highly_ discouraged.
